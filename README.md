This repository contains the **native implementation of interaction modes between a smartphone and a smartwatch**. It includes the development and validation of **bidirectional communication prototypes** using Android and Wear OS native APIs. 

Specifically, it covers the following interaction modes:

- **D-Pad:** Sending directional inputs (up, down, left, right) between devices.  
- **Forcebars:** Selecting and transmitting intensity levels.  
- **Joystick:** Capturing analog direction and magnitude inputs.  
- **Tap:** Sending simple tap signals as discrete events.

These prototypes are designed to verify **real-time communication reliability**, latency, and data integrity for future integration into game or interactive applications. All use cases are documented, including preconditions, actor definitions, and summarized flows.

# üöÄ Main Objectives

- Develop native Android and Wear OS apps for each interaction mode.
- Validate **bidirectional message transmission** between devices.
- Document implementation details and use cases for integration into Unity in the next development stage.

## üìÇ Structure

- `/app_mobile`: Smartphone native app implementation.
- `/app_wear`: Smartwatch native app implementation.
